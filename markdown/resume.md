Technical Experience
--------------------

[AI controlled model car](https://github.com/DoeringChristian/SNNL-car-simulator)
:   Implementation of a Neural network in C++ for controlling a model car with
a Raspberry Pi for a school project.\
A model car was equipped with five ultrasonic sensors. Then the neural network
was pre-trained using a generational algorithm in a simulated environment. In
the end this neural network was connected to the cars input sensors as well as
the controls. Tests where conducted to evaluate the object avoidance of the vehicle.

[Vulkan-rt](https://github.com/DoeringChristian/vulkan-rt)
:   Path tracer written in rust using the [screen-13](https://github.com/attackgoat/screen-13) library as a Vulkan abstraction.
    Supports Disney's BSDF with next event estimation.

Programming Languages
:   **C++:** Experience in modern C++ as well as C89 and C99.
    I have written Several projects in C/C++ from high level graphics
    applications to low level microcontroller code.
    
:   **Python:** Experience using python for writing scripts utilizing PyTorch, TensorFlow and mitsuba for ML.

:   **Rust:** Experience using Rust for GPGPU and Graphics programming.
    As Rust seems to be a promising new language for low and high
    level programming without some caveats of C++, I use it for my personal
    projects.

Other Abilities and Skills
--------------------------

* Languages:
    - German (Native speaker)
    - English (B2+/C1)
